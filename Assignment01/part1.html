    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2>Starting Dates</h2>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
        <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
        <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know which start date you would prefer. You can find more information on our <a href="#">university website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>

    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have an open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall in the realm of science and technology. Your submitted ideas intrigue us, particularly:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F) when audience sizes increase exponentially.</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please provide more details on each subject, including estimated research time, required staff, and resources.</p>

    <h2>Exotic Dance Moves</h2>

    <p>Regarding my post-doctorate studies, here are my favorite exotic dances:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Polynesian Chicken Dance</li>
        <li>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle</li>
        <li>Arctic Robot Dance</li>
    </ul>
